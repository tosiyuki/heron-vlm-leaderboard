        {readme_content}

        Please generate a Python code for an adapter class that can be used to run the model for the Vision and Language Leaderboard benchmark. The adapter should inherit from BaseAdapter and implement the generate_response and verify methods. Make sure to handle all necessary imports and implement proper error handling.

        Consider the specific requirements of the {model_name} model when choosing the appropriate classes and methods. The model might use custom classes or methods that are not part of the standard transformers library. If necessary, import these custom classes or implement custom logic based on the model's documentation.

        The adapter should follow this general structure and include the following features:

        ```python
        import torch
        from PIL import Image
        from typing import Dict, Any
        from adapters.base_adapter import BaseAdapter
        # Add any other necessary imports, including custom model classes if needed

                'torch>=1.9.0',
                'transformers>=4.20.0',
                'pillow>=8.0.0',
                # Add any other specific dependencies required by this model
            ]

                # Use the appropriate model class and initialization method

        Please ensure that the output is a complete Python code for the adapter, including all necessary imports. Do not include any additional content such as explanations or descriptions. Adjust the code as necessary based on the specific requirements of the {model_name} model, including using any custom classes, methods, or APIs that are specific to this model. Maintain the overall structure and error handling approach while adapting the implementation details to the model's unique characteristics.
